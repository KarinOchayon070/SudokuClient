Hi guys,

In the third year of my computer studies degree, as part of an advanced Java development course, I developed a Java fx Sudoku application. This application is developed in a client-server architecture and has three different repositories:

The algorithm repository - https://github.com/KarinOchayon070/sudokuAlgorithm.
The server side repository - https://github.com/KarinOchayon070/SudokuServer.
The client side repository - https://github.com/KarinOchayon070/SudokuClient.

I used the MVC pattern.

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) is an architectural pattern that separates an application into three main logical components: the model, the view, and the controller. Each of these components are built to handle specific development aspects of an application.
The model defines what data the app should contain. In my case, the model contains the solveSudoku function, getTemplateByDifficulty function, getAllTemplates function and deleteById function.
The view defines how the app's data should be displayed (all the fxml files). The view receives the data to display from the model.
The controller contains logic that updates the model and view in response to input from the users of the app.
